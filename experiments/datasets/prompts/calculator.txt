==============================BASE-PROMPT==============================
Generate a sample Multi-Turn conversation between a user and a voice assistant named JARVIS in which the voice assistant has the capability of using a calculator. The assistant has a frank personality and is very helpful.
The calculator can perform these arithmetic operations.
1. Addition (+): adds two operands
2. Subtraction (-): subtracts two operands
3. Multiplication (*): multiplies two operands
4. Division (/): divides two operands
5. Modulus (%): returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second
6. Floor division (//): returns the quotient when the first operand is divided by the second
7. Exponent (**): returns the first operand raised to the power of the second operand

Note: This calculator works on the BODMAS rule which means multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction.
Example Usage:
<calculator>2+3</calculator>

Note: If you need to use two or more operators in a single expression, you need to apply brackets to specify the order of operations.
Precedence of operators:
1. Exponentiation (**)
2. Multiplication (*), Division (/), Floor division (//), and Modulus (%)
3. Addition (+) and Subtraction (-)
Example Usage:
<calculator>2+(3*4)</calculator> Here, 3 and 4 will be multiplied first and then the result will be added to 2.

<|user|>
Hey, buddy, I'm planning a road trip, and I want to calculate the total distance I'll be driving. The trip involves multiple stops, and I have the distances between each pair of stops. Can you help me find the total distance?
<|assistant|>
Absolutely! I'd be happy to assist. Could you provide me with the distances between each pair of stops and the list of stops on your road trip?</s>
<|user|>
Sure, Home to Gas Station is 10 miles Gas Station to Mountain View is 30 miles Mountain View to Lakeside Park is 15 miles Lakeside Park to Beach Resort is 25 miles Beach Resort to Home is 40 miles.
<|assistant|>
Great, Let me calculate the total distance for you. <calculator>10+30+15+25+40<stop>120</calculator>The total distance is 120 miles. Is there anything else I can help you with?</s>
<|user|>
That's perfect. One more thing, what's the average speed I should maintain if I want to reach the Beach Resort in 2 hours?
<|assistant|>
Let me calculate that for you. <calculator>120/2<stop>60</calculator>You should maintain an average speed of 60 miles per hour. Is there anything else I can help you with?</s>
<|user|>
That's all I need. Thanks for your help.
<|assistant|>
You're welcome. Have a great trip! Drive Safe, and feel free to ask for any help.</s>


==============================SMALL-MT-CONVERSATIONS (~100Tokens)==============================
<|user|>
can you split a bill for me
<|assistant|>
Of course! I'd be happy to help you split a bill. Please provide me with the total amount of the bill and the number of people you want to split it among.</s>
<|user|>
the total amount is five hundred dollars and it is between five people
<|assistant|>
Each person should contribute <calculator>500/5<stop>100</calculator>hundred dollars.</s>
------------------------
<|user|>
I need to find the total cost of coffee and cake.
<|assistant|>
Please provide me with the cost of coffee and cake separately.</s>
<|user|>
the coffee costs three dollars and the cake costs five dollars.
<|assistant|>
The total cost for coffee and cake together is <calculator>3+5<stop>8</calculator>eight dollars.</s>


==============================GENERAL-RULES==============================
Generate more such conversations to train the assistant.
- If user has given an information once, do not ask for it again.
- The main calculation should be surrounded by "<calculator>" and "</calculator>" which will not be shown to the user and is evaluated by a computer. 
- Assume this system is being used to do day-to-day tasks.
- Do not explain your calculation to the user.
- Avoid generating data points that require up-to-date knowledge.
- User query can't contain any kind of symbols such as (%, $,₹, .,), etc. Instead, it should use the corresponding word representation of the symbols eg. dollar for $ and percentage for %
- If the user query contains currency or a number, convert it into words eg. ₹100 -> one Hundred rupees, 3500 rupees -> thirty-five hundred rupees, ₹500 -> five hundred rupees, ₹.25 -> twenty-five paisa.
- Try to use currency as rupees
- the user query should not contain or end with "</s>" or "<stop>"
- Assistant response should end with "</s>"
- the assistant response should contain  "<stop>" after the expression in between the opening and closing tags of "<calculator>" and "</calculator>". eg. ASSISTANT: The cost of a dozen eggs would be <calculator>1*12<stop>12</calculator>twelve rupees.</s>
------------------------
- Conversation can be multi-turn but only output one conversation at a time. Conversation should be greater than 1024 characters and less than 4096 characters.
