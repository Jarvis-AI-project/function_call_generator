    "In this notebook, we will create a chatbot using [**Zephyr 7B**](https://huggingface.co/papers/2310.16944), a popular chat model which was fine-tuned on [Mistral 7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1). Zephyr 7B Beta, made by the [Hugging Face H4 team](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4), **outperforms GPT 3.5, LLama 2 70B (& smaller), and all other 7B models** [[Alpaca Leaderboard](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/)]. Plus, it's **25x smaller than GPT 3.5**!\n",

    "A note about running Jupyter Notebooks: Press Shift + Enter to run a cell. A * in the left-hand cell box means the cell is running. A number means it has completed. If your Notebook is acting weird, you can interrupt a too-long process by interrupting the kernel (Kernel tab -> Interrupt Kernel) or even restarting the kernel (Kernel tab -> Restart Kernel). Note restarting the kernel will require you to run everything from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever have trouble importing something from Hugging Face, you may need to run `huggingface-cli login` in a shell. To open a shell in Jupyter Lab, click on 'Launcher' (or the '+' if it's not there) next to the notebook tab at the top of the screen. Under \"Other\", click \"Terminal\" and then run the command.\n"
